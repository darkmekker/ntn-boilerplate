  heading: WE ARE CYCLICAL THINKERS
  text: |-
    When one of our products has completed its task 
    in a production chain, that is far from the end: 
    we take back our technology and upcycle it for the next use. 
    In the process, we can hybridize heating elements 
    to make them fit for use with renewable energies.

        stable and above all harmless materials are used.  At the same time, the
        steel construction is beautified, if necessary.
