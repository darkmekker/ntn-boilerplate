The surface cross-linking takes place through flame treatment. promeos has set a new standard for this. With the help of the flame-free IR burner reo, a 360° radiation tunnel was designed that covers the entire surface of the extrudate equally intensively. Two radiators are arranged vis-a-vis, between which the pipe is guided. The short heating times and the penetration depth increase productivity significantly. The combination of IR camera and point pyrometer also allows optimal and dynamic performance adjustment for finishing different pipe thicknesses and materials. As a stand-alone solution, the furnace can also be integrated into existing pro- duction systems as a fully functional unit. #smart #solutions for #clean #processes #heatelligence
