When smelting secondary aluminum, the scrap material is preheated before charged into the melting furnace. organic waste such as plastic coatings are gasified by pyrolysis and must be cleaned before leaving the plant. promeos has developed an integrated TNV (thermal post-combustion), a thermal post-combustion system to convert the ingredients according to local standards and emission regulations. A flameless burner is integrated into an insulated reaction chamber, which raises the process gases to the prescribed reaction temperature by means of exhaust gas admixture. The heatintelligent design of the chamber guarantees a homogeneous mixture in the smallest of spaces, preventing the formation of strands and resulting in an unrivaled compact TNV. We design heat - safety included. #smart #solutions for #clean #processes #heatelligence
