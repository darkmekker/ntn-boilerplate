When smelting secondary aluminum, organic waste such as plastic coatings are gasified by pyrolysis and must be cleaned before leaving the plant. promeos has developed an integrated TNV (thermal post-combustion), a thermal post-combustion system to convert the ingredients according to local standards and emission regulations. A flameless burner is integrated into an insulated reaction chamber, which raises the process gases to the prescribed reaction temperature by means of exhaust gas admixture. The heat-intelligent design of the chamber guarantees a homogeneous mixture in the smallest of spaces, preventing the formation of strands and resulting in an unrivaled compact TNV. We design heat - safety included! #smart #solutions for #clean #processes #heatelligence
