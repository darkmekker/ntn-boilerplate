Crucibles made of clay graphite or SiC are potted. As always, the manufacturing process consists of shaping and firing. The latter takes place in large, gas-fired hearth furnaces. The organic binders required for shaping evaporate during the kiln runs even at low temperatures and have to be post-combusted in a TNV. promeos develops and builds TNVs of various dimensions. The TNV presented here has a burner capacity of 1 MW. The heat intelligent, flameless burner unit can also be used as pure air injection to react high concentrations with auto-ignition.  We design heat - safety included.  #smart #solutions for #clean #processes #heatelligence
