Hot forming is a strenuous process. The required closing forces of the press depend on the product geometry and the material - the hotter, the softer and the less force is required. The pre- and intermediate heating of the pressing tools represents a quality-enhancing but above all energy-saving step - and promeos provides optimal solutions for this.Here, a fully automated concept with separate heating systems for the upper and lower mould was designed. It contains both the heating technology and the two-axis automation system on linear transfer cars to enter the press from two sides.   + completely automated for 120% remote operation + homogeneous T field @ highest power density + low emissions  + low noise emissions
