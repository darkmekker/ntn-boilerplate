Industrial baking is a delicious but delicate business. The result is delicious enough to eat, but the process is anything but trivial - an exciting topic for culinary experts and engineers alike.  The combination of recipe, humidity and temperature control reminds us of the alchemists - true artists of process engineering. Because we see ourselves as their successor, we have dedicated ourselves to baking and put the ingenuity of our flameless burners at its service - the result is truly impressive:   30% of energy savings at 20% increase of productivity are an impressive documentation of  our expertise and our passion. We design heat â€“ for all you can h/eat!  #heat #solutions for #food and #allyoucanheat #processes with #heatelligence
