Correction welding of casted products is kind of an art - it needs to be learned and beloved! The repair of casting defects by manual welding must neither provoke stresses in the product nor leave real defects. In addition to the skill of the welder, the preheating of the component is also important - the mass should continue to provide heat as long as the artist lends a hand!Promeos offers taylormade glowing furnaces for all kinds of products â€“ the artist defines his needs and promeos decorates its atelier with a heatelligent tool. We design heat for the art of welding.   + homogeneous T field + low emissions  + low noise emissions  #sustainable #pragmatic #efficient #engineering #madeinGermany
