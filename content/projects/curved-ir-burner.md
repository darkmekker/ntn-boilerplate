Welding needs to be learned - and well heated! Preheating the weld seam is essential, especially with thick materials, in order to avoid stresses caused by the high temperature gradients that occur during the process.The IR radiating flameless burner reo offers the optimum tool for homogeneous, efficient and fast heat transfer into metallic surfaces. Circumferential welds for the manufacture of wind turbine towers is one of the many applications.  + mobile / easily to be integrated + high power density + homogeneous T field + low emissions + low noise emissions
