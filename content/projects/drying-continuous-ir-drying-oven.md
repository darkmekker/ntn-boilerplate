* for most efficient drying of porous bulk materials combines IR and convective heat transfer 
* humidity control 
* e.g. for clay products production, e.g. crucibles

The drying process of porous bulk material needs to be diffusion optimized. The by far most efficient drying process combines IR heat transfer for heat release, convection transport of water vapor and a surface heating to trigger the diffusion of humidity to the buld surface. promeos developed a modular furnace concept, that combines the three mechanisms to offer an optimum triad to the processes material. heatelligenceÂ® at its best - efficient, low emission and modular scalable to the required mass flow and type of material.
