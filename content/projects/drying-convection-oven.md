The drying process of refractory modules such a launders, oven covers etc. still is done by open flames. The traditional installed “barbecue type” of drying has been established decades ago and not been revised since then. However, none of the people involved would dry their hair with an open flame J. Any heir dryer uses hot air … sound funny, doesn’t it? We like fun, but we also like sustainability – therefore we offer taylor made closed drying solution with internal heat recovery for minimum energy consumption. heatelligence® - the simpler the better.
