* hot air generation 
* integration into existing printing machines 
* modular design for maximum flexibility 
* For new machines and modernization 

The printing process of paper and foils is done in consecutive printing modules for each color, including their own drying chambers, which should be controlled individually. promeos developed so-called heatcubes – hot air modules, that offers the requested convection flow at the temperature range needed for an optimum drying result. Thanks to the flameless and most compact burner technology, the cubes are designed as “heated blower cells” with burners integrated in the suction nozzle of the blowers. Stepless modulation of both burner capacity and blower speed allow the realization of a wide operational parameter field without modifying the unmatched quality of the combustion. In addition, the serial add-on installation of eletrical heating for full hybrid functionality is prepared for the next generation of products.
