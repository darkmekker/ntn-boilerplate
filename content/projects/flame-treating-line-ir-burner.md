Carpet production includes the gelling of the backing layer. The optimum heat treament process to support the pre-curing process should be named “flameless treatment” instead of flame treatment since it works best using heatelligent promeos radiating burner technology. A 6m line type of IR burner was developed to be refitted into the carpet production line. The modular design of the burner allows to process different product dimensions by partially shutting down different burner segments. #smart #solutions for #clean #processes #heatelligence
