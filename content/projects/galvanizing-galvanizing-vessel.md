The homogeneity of temperature field offered to a large galvanizing vessels is the key parameter for both energy efficiency and vessel life time â€“ therefore, free flame based heating concepts such as high velocity burners or flat flame burners suffer either from low efficiency or from lifetime issues due to hot spots. The heat release offered by promeos line type flameless burners overcomes these limitations, since the convective heat flows at low velocity parallel to the vessel, covering the whole surface of the vessel for a smart but absolutely homogeneous heat transfer process. 25+X % reduction of gas consumption is proven as well as positive lifetime development by the avoidance of hot spots.
