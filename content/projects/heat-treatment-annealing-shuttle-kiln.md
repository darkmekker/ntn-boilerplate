* Optimum temperature control for annealing 
* Total capacity: 2.400 kW (12 x 200 kW) 
* Target T: 1200°C 

The heat treatment of stainless steel products is a key process to adapt its physical and mechanical properties and residual stress. The aim is to get the best performance of stainless steel. Flameless heat with low velocity flue gases offered by individually designed promeos burners offer an optimum tool to design temperature fields at optimum fluid mechanics – the prerequisite to controle the thermal process even in large oven chambers. promeos designed this 20t gas-heated furnace that meets the class A requirements for electric furnaces. Another proof of the innovation power and engineering excellence of the promeos team.
