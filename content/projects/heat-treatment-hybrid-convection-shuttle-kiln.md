* Optimum temperature control for annealing 
* Total capacity: 200kW 
* Fully hybrid (gas and electrical heat) 
* T max: 700 °C 

The heat treatment of aluminium products is a key process to adapt its physical and mechanical properties and residual stress. promeos has designed directly gas heated blowers, that can be integrated into new and existing convection ovens without interacting with optionally installed electric heating elements. Flameless heat with no combustion chamber allowed to design a fully hybrid shuttle kiln for light metal annealing!Of course, digital control with remote operation and process visualization is state of the art – heatelligence® in the truest sense of the word!
