- High capacity hot air generation  - Integration into existing drying plant - Humidity control    The drying process of raw material in copper mills requires high volume flows of hot air.  Here, the substitution of high power density steam heat exchangers due to the dismanteling of the existing steam infrastructure, was the challenge. The minimum space for heat injection required a maximum heat density without the space for combustion chambers. With promeos flameless heatelligence, there’s very few things impossible!  The burner setup we developed offers a power density of 6 MW/m2 – a total capacity of 1.5 MW per drying line. We design heat – a lot of heat if required!
