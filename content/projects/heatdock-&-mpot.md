Where secondary aluminium is produced from recycled aluminium scrap, a separate analysis of the material has to define its purity. The mobile and modular design of the promeos mpot & heatdock – concept allows the most efficient remelting process of the different charges. When every sample gets its own mpot, the different charges can be melted one by one without intermediate cleaning breaks  - the most productive and efficient way, including heat recovering in the twin heatdock concept. Optimum logistics meets best available efficiency – we design heat, but much more, if required!  Sustainability at its best: most efficient recycling at highest productivity.
