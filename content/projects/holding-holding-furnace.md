* for aluminium (light metal) and non-ferrous alloys (e.g. zinc, copper, brass) 

Holding the material temperature during stand by or dosing time is essential for a reliable product quality in casting. As liquid chocolate is kept on temperature best in a homogeneous water bath surrounding the chocolate pot, flue gases of totally premixed combustion surround the filled melting pot in promeos crucible holding furnaces. Due to homogeneous and effective heat transfer verifiable energy savings of up to 35 % are achieved compared. This leads to extended crucible lifetime and reduces production stops.
