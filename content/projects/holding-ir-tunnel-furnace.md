* Optimum temperature control for pipe production 
* Total capacity: 250 kW 
* Target T: 1100°C 
* Pipe diameters: 15-70 cm 

After fast heating by induction, stainless steel pipes have to be kept at 1100°C for thermal conditioning. The holding process requires full axial symmetry, regardless of the pipe diameter – a challenge due to the local character of both electric and gas IR radiators. A 360° radiating tunnel was designed by promeos, utilizing indirect heat transfer. The interface between the burner chambers and the product acts as IR shield and heat distributor. WE DESIGN HEAT - 360° if necessary.
