*  Optimum temperature control for cast strand solidification 
*  Unlimited design flexibility for minimum furnace volumes 
*  Total capacity: 2,6 MW 
*  high power density of > 3 MW/m2 

Due to the absence of flames, promeos premix burner modules can be integrated where minimum space is available, as in continuous casting steel plants. The taylor made furnace modules were designed as “heat jackets” to avoid fast cooling during the solidification of the steel strand. Where outstanding technology meets engineering excellence, outstanding solutions are created to improve quality, save energy and reduce the CO2 footpoint of industrial production.
