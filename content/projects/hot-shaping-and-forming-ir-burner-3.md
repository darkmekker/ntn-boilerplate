A gravity bending process without the use of a furnace was demonstrated. Preheating, softening, gravity forming and controlled annealing was done with a promeos superheating burner reo®. Its IR heat emission correspondents in wavelength with the absorption spectrum of the glass. Excellent results with the first trials underline the huge upside potential for this technology. We design heat – and smart glass products in any shape manageable! #smart #solutions for a #digital and #clean #future
