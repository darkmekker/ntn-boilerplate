• Optimum temperature control for annealing • Total capacity: 60 kW • Fully hybrid (gas and electrical heat) • T max: 700°C  The heat treatment of aluminium products is a key process to adapt its physical and mechanical properties and residual stress. promeos has upgraded existing electrical heated chamber ovens to fully hybrid chamber ovens by smartly integrating flameless gas burners without changing the furnace chamber or fluid mechanics, respectively.  Of course, digital control with remote operation and process visualization is state of the art – heatelligence® in the truest sense of the word!
