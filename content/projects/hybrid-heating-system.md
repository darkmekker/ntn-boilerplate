Industrial washing (and drying) finds a wide range of applications.  Wherever clean products are transported in-house in reusable packaging, such as plastic boxes, the latter have to be cleaned regularly  - washing and drying machines are doing this job. Extremely compact flameless burners provide the convection flow to indirectly heat the wash liquor via an air-to-water heat exchanger. The dry air flow is brought in by direct heating in highly integrated dryer modules - individually integrated heatcubes, standardized on customer request. We design heat – for proper things!  •Flameless Gas burners or electric heating  - easy plug&play integration •High energy efficiency (“direct heat injection” @ low temp.) •Enormous reduction of CO2 emissions •Easy to make “refit” of existing machines •approved worldwide. meets all standards: EU, USA, Australia
