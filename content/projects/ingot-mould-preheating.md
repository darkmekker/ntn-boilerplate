-for aluminium (light metal) and non-ferrous alloys (e.g. zinc, copper, brass)  Recycling and / or ingot casting is done in fully automized casting machines. promeos offers IR radiating systems to dry and preheat the moulds before filled with liquid aluminium. The high power density flameless burners can easily be integrated into existing machines to substitute  inefficient flame burners or to boost the temperature for process optimization. We design heat – process upgrading for more quality and les CO2. …
