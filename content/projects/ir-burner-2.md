A vacuum shaping process was developed to shape backlight panels for large TV screens.  The combination of two plates containing a set of parallel half shells to result in a bundle of parallel glass pipes was the target. To shape the glass was softened by the promeos superheating burner reo®. Its IR heat emission correspondents in wavelength with the absorption spectrum of the glass. Excellent results with the first trials underline the huge upside potential for this technology. We design heat – and smart glass products in any shape manageable!  #smart #solutions for a #digital and #clean #future
