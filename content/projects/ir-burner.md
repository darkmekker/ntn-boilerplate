3D designed thin glass is already used for numerous smart products - an increasing request will occur from the exploding market of digital touch applications. To shape the glass it has to be softened – controlled heat is therefore the prerequisite to manage the challenging process of forming, regardless of which process will be applied: gravity bending, vacuum forming or hot stamping. promeos has established a superheating device that might play a major role in the future process development – the porous burner reo®. Its IR heat emission correspondents in wavelength with the absorption spectrum of the relevant glass types selected for smart products. To homogenize the heat release and to increase the resolution of partial heating opportunities are the game changers in technology and therefore key development subjects of promeos. We design heat – in any shape manageable!  #smart #solutions for a #digital and #clean #future
