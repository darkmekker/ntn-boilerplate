Where secondary aluminium is produced from recycled aluminium scrap, a separate analysis of the material has to define its purity. In addition, the remelting pants require low capacity lab infrastructure to melt and design their alloys.  Due to the absence of a space consuming flame, the promeos melting furnaces can be minimized as requested. The customer defines its crucible and we provide a taylormade“heat jacket”. WE DESIGN HEAT at any shape and dimension.
