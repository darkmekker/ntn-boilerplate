- for aluminium (light metal) - Launders, filter boxes, tundish , â€¦   The optimum control of the alloy temperature all along the production chain is essential for the casting process. Therefore, the best preheating of the transfer and casting launders is a key challenge, especially in long and complex casting plants.  promeos developed a portfolio of heatelligent solutions, containing both high energy line burner systems for maximum heat release as well as hot air based products for maximum energy efficiency. Design flexibility and modularity, combined with taylormade adaptation to the existing plant secures best temperature homogeneity, minimum stress and aging of the refractory as well as optimum energy efficiency.
