When glass is tempered, it goes through a thermally controlled toughening process to increase its strength compared with normal or conventional glass. The products are exposed to an exactly defined temperature curve along its journey through the temper line. Homogeneously radiant burner modules, easy to be integrated into furnace wall or ceiling and with infinite variable power density makes the process control a „child’s play“. promeos has modernized five tempering lines at different plants of the world market leader for table ware, Pasabahce. A reduction of scrap from 15% to 1% and a 30% reduction of the energy consumption are impressing reference for promeos heatelligence®.  #flameless #tempering #sustainable #production
