Magnesium melting furnaces contain “tube-shaped” stainless steel crucibles – the heating requires a homogeneous temperature field in an non-axisymmetric chamber.   Applying flameless promeos burners, hot flue gases from one or several burner modules evenly heat the furnace chamber around the crucible.  As a consequence, a steady, practically constant heat exchange via gas radiation and convection takes place. This avoids thermal stress due to spot heating, resulting in a drastically increased lifetime of the crucible. In addition, the crucible itself can be optimized in terms of conductivity and mechanical stability.
