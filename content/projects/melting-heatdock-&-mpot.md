m.pot and heatdock combine the functions of the melting furnace, transport pan and dosing or scooping furnace into a single system. The heat energy provided in highly integrated heating stations (heatdocks) is given to mobile furnace bodies (m.pots), which are transported directly to the value-adding casting stations and replace the holding furnaces that were previously used there.
