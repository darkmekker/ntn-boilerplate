 The promeos tiltable crucible furnace with flameless gas burner technology stands for a high energy efficiency and increased effectiveness on melting of Aluminium, and non-ferrous alloys. Flue gases of totally premixed and almost stoichiometric combustion surround crucible without “hot spots” and due to homogeneous and effective heat transfer verifiable energy savings of up to 35 % will be achieved. This leads to extended crucible lifetime and reduces production stops. Reduced velocity and heating without open flame avoid erosion and enable application of light isolation materials with low density.
