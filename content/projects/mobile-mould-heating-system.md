Hot forming is a strenuous process. The required closing forces of the press depend on the product geometry and the material - the hotter the softer and the less force is required. The pre- and intermediate heating of the pressing tools represents a quality-enhancing but above all energy-saving step - and promeos provides optimal solutions for this.Here, a mobile system for heating the moulds inside the press was designed. It can be handled with a fork lift and has fast energy couplers for multi-press use. In addition, it can be adapted to any existing plant at modernization.  + mobile  + multi press usage  + homogeneous T field  + low emissions  + low noise emissions + Sustainablility for refurbished plants!
