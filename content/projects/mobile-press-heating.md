Hot forming is a strenuous process. The hotter and softer the material, the less force is required. Of course, preheating of the moulds inside the press is time consuming and a loss of production time. Therefore, the faster the heating, the higher the productivity.   promeos offers a mobile heating system which combines the high-T preheating  of the stamping tools with actively heated tool carriers at much lower temperature. This reduces the heat loss by conductivity and accelerates the heat-up speed for less stand-bye time.   We design heat – and combine different solutions to our customer’s benefit.   #sustainable #pragmatic #efficient #engineering #madeingermany
