*  for aluminium (light metal) and non
* ferrous alloys (e.g. zinc, copper, brass) 
*  low pressure casting: mould preheating stations 
*  die casting moulds: robot 

The core of any foundry is the cast house, where the material gets into shape to form high quality products. Product quality is a function of alloy (material recipe), mould surface (coating) quality and temperature control. During the solidification process, the heat management becomes the most relevant process.The wide range of casting procedures and the infinite variety of product and mould geometries require a variety of heating solutions. The flameless and powerful promeos heating technologies offers such a portfolio of preheating solutions.
