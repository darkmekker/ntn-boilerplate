Hot forming of small to medium sized bolts of different alloys is used to produce components for high voltage coupling. The preheating of the bolts is realized in a so-called continuous flow pusher furnace which linearly clocks the product blanks through the tunnel furnace. Homogeneously heated bolts at the optimum exit temperature guarantee an optimum product quality and maximum process efficiency. Promeos developed a heating chamber based on its flameless linear burner design, which is aligned with the linear transport line of the products to be heated.  We design heat â€“ in line with the customer's need. #sustainable #pragmatic #efficient #engineering #madeingermany
