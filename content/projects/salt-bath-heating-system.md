Special rubber profiles, e.g. with inner surfaces or such produced from hyperoxide materials, are produced in salt bath lines instead of hot air tunnels following the an extrusion process.  The profiles are pulled through a liquid salt channel at a bath temperature of about 300°C. The melting and holding energy of gas fired systems is provided indirectly from burners below the stainless steel tube.  promeos flameless burners offer a high power density but absolutely homogeneous heat source – the tube is surrounded by a soup of hot gases similar to the water when melting chocolate in a water bath. This avoids hotspots and reduces the maintenance effort enormously, and all this with unrivaled energy efficiency. We design heat – directly or indirectly, whatever is best! #hot #solutions for #fast #heating #processes with #heatelligence
