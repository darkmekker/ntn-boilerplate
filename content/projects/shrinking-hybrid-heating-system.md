The flameless heating solutions from promeos make shrink tunnels energy-efficient. In shrink ovens, a precise temperature distribution is required for an optimal packaging process by shrinking wafer-thin films (thickness > 40 μm). The warm air drawn off in the heating chambers through a bundle of hoses must be the same in each strand so that a stable shrink-off assembly is created. promeos developed most homogeneous heat sources, both for gas and electricity, guaranteeing an optimum temperature distribution at any capacity, production speed, respectively. #heatsource #hybrid #plugandplay #lowCO2 

* Flameless Gas burners or electric heating 
* easy plug&play integration 
* High energy efficiency (“direct heat injection” @ low temp.) 
* Enormous reduction of CO2 emissions 
* Dramatically reduced operating costs (actually > 50% in most EU countries) 
* Easy to make “refit” of existing machines 
* > 500 systems in the market 
* approved worldwide. meets all standards: EU, USA, Australia
