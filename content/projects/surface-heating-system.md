High temperature galvanizing of small products is realized in surface heated diving furnaces. The interaction between the flame and the melting bath defines both energy efficiency and material losses due to oxidation. Other than flame burners, the flameless promeos line burners provide a low velocity smart convective heat flow over the material. The increased dwell time combined with better homogeneity increases the energy transfer into the melting and at the same time reduces the scrap production due to its reduced mechanical interaction with the bath skin.  A substantial increase in both energy and material efficiency has been proven.
