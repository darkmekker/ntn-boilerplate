IR radiative heat was needed to be integrated into an existing production process to temper and “relax” high quality glass pipes for illuminant. While a long effective heating time was requested, the power density had to be far below the standards of any burner, including promeos flameless burner lines. To solve the problem, promeos developed a perforated radiating surface, which is being heated from the back to multiplying the heat distributing surface. Optimum IR radiation can be designed in many ways – we always strive for the best! #innovation #engineering #heat #design #heatelligence
