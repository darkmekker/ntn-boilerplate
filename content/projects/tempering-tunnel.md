The hardening of ampoules for pharmaceutical liquids requires high demands on the temperature curve along the heat treatment. promeos therefore designed a tunnel kiln, which initially introduces IR radiation with high power density into the glass, followed by a conventional heating section for controlled cooling and relaxation. The existing walking beam transport system was retained - modernization to reduce CO2 on existing furnaces! we design heat, for new and existing systems.  #flameless #annealing ##modernization #sustainable #production
