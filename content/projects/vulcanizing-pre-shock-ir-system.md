Vulcanization is a chemical process in which the rubber is heated with sulphur, accelerator and activator at 140–160°C to trigger the formation of cross-links between long rubber molecules so as to achieve improved elasticity, resilience, tensile strength, viscosity, hardness and weather resistance. Rubber profiles are produced in an extrusion process, followed by a hot air vulcanization tunnel. For fast surface vulcanization of the lower product side, which is laying on the tunnel furnace band, a so-called pre-shock vulcanization reactor is installed, providing a powerful IR radiation. promeos porous burners offer the optimum fast heating solution by combining IR radiation with high T convection transferred into the lower side of the product. We design heat – as powerful as required! #hot #solutions for #fast #heating #processes with #heatelligence
