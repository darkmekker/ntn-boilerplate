Industrial washing (and drying) of textile needs industrial machines running 24/7. The more powerful the washing capacity, the more heat for drying is needed. promeos designed tailormade burners into commercial machines, making use of the fact that a combustion chamber is not needed. We design heat – for proper things! 

* Flameless Gas burners 
* High energy efficiency (“direct heat injection”) 
* Enormous reduction of CO2 emissions 
* Easy to make “refit” of existing machines 
* approved worldwide. meets all standards: EU, USA, Australia
