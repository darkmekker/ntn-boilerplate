Industrial washing (and drying) finds a wide range of applications. Wherever clean products are transported in-house in reusable packaging, such as plastic boxes, the latter have to be cleaned regularly - washing and drying machines are doing this job. Extremely compact flameless burners provide the convection flow to indirectly heat the wash liquor via an air-to-water heat exchanger. The dry air flow is brought in by direct heating in highly integrated dryer modules - individually integrated heatcubes, standardized on customer request. We design heat – for proper things! 

* Flameless Gas burners or electric heating - easy plug&play integration 
* High energy efficiency (“direct heat injection” @ low temp.) 
* Enormous reduction of CO2 emissions 
* Easy to make “refit” of existing machines 
* approved worldwide. meets all standards: EU, USA, Australia
