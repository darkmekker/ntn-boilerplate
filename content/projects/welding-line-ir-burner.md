Welding needs to be learned - and well heated! Preheating the weld seam is essential, especially with thick materials, in order to avoid stresses caused by the high temperature gradients that occur during the process.The IR radiating flameless burner reo offers the optimum tool for homogeneous, efficient and fast heat transfer into metallic surfaces such as steel plates to be formed to pipes / pipelines. promeos has installed burner systems into every single production line of its customer and international market leader in the manufacturing of large-diameter steel pipes, EEW. 

* mobile / easily to be integrated 
* homogeneous T field 
* low emissions 
* low noise emissions
